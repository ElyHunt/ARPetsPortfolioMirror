### Description
The menu interface can be described as a menu that is clearly visible, easy to navigate, but not distracting to the user.<br>The menu interface should have easy access to a multitude of options: tutorials, user account, settings, feed or play, quit,<br> etc. Depending on the type of equipment that is used, the menu can be accessed in two ways. The first via buttons <br> (Oculus Touch), and the second via motion (Leap Motion).
