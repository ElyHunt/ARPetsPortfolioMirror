## Description

A 'Grab' needs to be described differently based upon what control scheme is used. The oculus has a grab button and it would be prudent to use that, but for the Leap Motion, a grab should be initiated when the distance between the fingers and thumb is smaller than a distance 'd1' which should be empirically determined.
