## Description

The 'Throwing' gesture is best described in two stages.

### Stage 1: Grab + motion

The first stage of a throw requires an object to be held, and while that object is held, motion is applied in a certain direction.

### Stage 2: Release

While still in motion, the grab is released and the object continues along its current trajectory starting with the speed that it had at release and follows that trajectory til either gravity or collision brings it to a stop.
