# VR Pets

COSC 4955: Senior Design

University of Wyoming Department of Computer Science

## Team: The Code Monkeys

Josh Bartling, Elliot Hunt, Kyle Mitchell, and Kurt Risley, with Kip DeCastro

## The problem and the idea

Problem *for* the project: Choose an interesting project for Senior Design
### Josh and I met our first year in CoSci. We were in 1030 and we agreed we just wanted to make a game.
### 

Problem *of* the project: Living alone in an apartment that doesn't allow pets can get very lonely

Solution: An idea for Augmented Reality Pets (Tamagotchi for the Space Age)

Solution: Create a virtual companion that users can interact with and take care of

## The goal and the plan

Build a virtual pets game for augmented reality hardware

Users could interact with a companion in situations where having a pet isn't allowed or feasible

Make a game by requiring users to take care of the pet

We're not building a mobile app; not going for a smart version of Playmoji or a lame version of Pokemon Go

## Trial at a threshhold

Technology is apparently not available. Augmented Reality is way too young as a platform

Any currently available solutions are limited, are prototypes, or need to be built before we can start

Partial solutions (3D camera that can feed into an HMD) are expensive and difficult to obtain

Our project was plagued with problems. Compiler errors, fighting Unity, Fighting GitHub, and... our project got HAUNTED. Our fox even got possessed???

## Right turn: how do we adapt

Can we "settle" for a VR version? Less novel, but well-supported, and still a challenge

A VR game should be easy to extend into an AR game, once the technology is within reach (right?)

VR is still young, and needs our help! Still plenty of opportunity for good and unique games for the current platforms

## The new plan

[Greater detail for this section; describe plans made for current game and intended timeline]

## The journey

[Discuss progress, problems, successes, setbacks, fun stuff that happened]

## How far we've come

[Description of game we have so far, features, additions, etc.]

## Where we're going

[Mention plans for next steps and later goals]
