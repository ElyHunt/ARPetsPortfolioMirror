## Art: The components that make up the look of the application

## Elements of Design
In art theory, the elements of design are a way of breaking down artistic design into manageable pieces.
This allows loose, subjective guidelines to be defined as a means of guiding the design of a product.
See here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_design_elements_and_principles
Additionally, I've added another section, "Intangibles" to function on any elements not spoken to here.

The elements are as follows:


### Color
--Lighter, Brighter colors should be used to contrast menu elements
and elements that can be interacted with from the rest of the environment.

### Line
--Bolder, darker outlines should be favored over thinner, lighter ones
in order to differentiate lighter colors from lighter environments.

### Shape
--Basic shapes are easier to render and quicker for people to recognize and should,
at least initially, be more favored.

### Texture
--Texture for menus can be a paper-like texture, or something subtle to create starker
contrast with the background.
--Textures may not be necessary in all cases.

### Space
--There should be a lot of space without too much clutter, simply because we're affecting
a user's vision directly, and cluttering their vision or making something too distracting
could be a hazard.

### Form
--Gradients of shading should be slightly gentle with, hopefully, a shading that can
integrate slightly with the environment to give the illusion of 3D, but still be distinguishable

### Intangibles
--All of these elements together should, in theory, result in a slightly more cartoony look.
--If later on, we want to make things more realistic, we can make more realistic animations
and improve upon our models/make more joints, etc. etc. etc.
--This provides a safe initial version with room for later graphical updates and refining.
