## Meetings

There should be three type of meetings we do:

1. Daily standup: This can be a meeting or just a posting in the group chat regarding what you worked on today, or where you're stuck
2. Weekly meetings: We should meet in person once a week to discuss planning, design or anything that can't be settled in chat
3. Post-iteration Retro: This will take place the weekend before our iteration presentation so we can go through what we've done and plan our presentation

### Proposed Times

Daily: post by 8PM \
Weekly: 4:00PM to 5:00PM in EN4066 \
Post-Iteration: Sunday at 4:00PM

## Areas of concern

We've discussed it earlier and the main areas of concern to complete this project are as follows:

- Art: The components that make up the look of the application
- Behaviors: The behaviors of the pet that make it feel alive
- Interface: The feel of the application
- Back end: The databases and other business necessary for the rest to function

## Development methodology

I recommend we use agile. It is by far the most common methodology, it works and we should be familiar with it. So development would proceed for our iterations as follows:

1. Planning: Define the problem
2. Requirements Analysis: Define what specifically needs to be done to solve the problem
3. Design: Mock-ups and pseudo-code
4. Coding: Write it!
5. Testing: Does it meet the requirements?
6. Documentation: Let everyone else know what you did

Here's what a standup update could look like:

```
Today I worked on setting up the database in unity. I am currently in the design state and researching current best practices. I have some questions about preferred database interactions I'd like to bring up (and so on)
```

So Agile works in iterations. I propose we work in one week iterations. More on Agile when we meet.

## Schedule

Lets work togethere and figure out the schedule for these four areas.
